# Sustainable Plastics Project

This repository presents part of the work developed under the **Sustainable Plastics Project**, a national initiative supported by the **Green Agendas for Business Innovation** within Portugalâ€™s **Recovery and Resilience Plan (RRP)** and the **Next Generation EU** framework.

The project aims to drive the plastics industry toward sustainability and circularity through innovation, research, and technological advancement.

The **Sustainable Plastics Project** seeks to transform the national plastics sector by promoting eco-friendly design, recycling efficiency, and reduction of COâ‚‚ emissions. It is organized into seven Work Packages (WP) and 14 PPS (Processes, Products, and Services), engaging industrial partners, academic institutions, and public entities.

### ðŸ”¬ My Contribution

During my participation in this project, I was involved in developing several machine learning and computer vision solutions focused on **automated defect detection** and **decision support systems** for production environments.
These contributions formed part of the R&D efforts towards smarter, data-driven manufacturing pipelines and sustainable production monitoring.

The following repositories were developed as part of this work but remain **private due to NDA restrictions**:

- **`decisionSupportApp`** â€“ Application integrating model predictions with production decision workflows.
- **`defectDetection-baseline`** â€“ Baseline experiments using state-of-the-art object detection architectures.
- **`defectDetection-yoloLwF`** â€“ Incremental learning implementation based on YOLOv8 and Learning without Forgetting (LwF) to preserve model knowledge across training iterations.

Although these repositories are private, the work and methodologies developed are discussed in the published article below.

### ðŸŒ± Project Context

The **Sustainable Plastics** initiative aligns with the national and European goals for a circular economy by:

- Increasing the circularity and efficiency of plastic resources,
- Encouraging the reuse, recycling, and repair of plastic products,
- Integrating alternative raw materials into production,
- Reducing COâ‚‚ emissions following the **PNEC 2030** and **RNC 2050** objectives.
